*Complete and verify answer before completing the rest of the question.*

### Part 2

Write a solution in C or C++ performing the split in a function.

### Extra Credit

Write a solution in Python performing the split in a function.

## Question 2

Write a solution to [Question 1](#Question-1) in C or C++ performing the split
as a macro.

## Question 3

In C or C++, implement an inline solution to *set* a particular bit in a 32-bit
