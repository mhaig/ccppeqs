# ccppeqs

Collection of C, C++, and general Embedded questions.

## Goal

Create a working set of questions and challenges related to lower level language
skills that tend to atrophy in the world of high level languages and frameworks.
The target is for each question to take no more than an hour to solve but, as
it is a work in progress, there may be some outliers as the questions build.
